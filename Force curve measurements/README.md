Here are the force curves I have so far. This page is frequently updated. The force curves here (the PNG and .ods files) are licensed under the [Creative Commons 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). 

If you don't know how to read a force curve, [HaaTa](https://www.keebtalk.com/t/how-to-read-a-force-curve/65) and [ThereminGoat](https://www.theremingoat.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-force-curves) have good intro articles.

I am planning a reorganization of this page soon, as it is getting quite long now. Until then - Ctrl-F is probably the best way to navigate this.

# Springs

* Note that springs may measure differently depending on the housing they are installed in, as different housings may preload the spring differently. This is discussed in somewhat in [this KeebTalk thread](https://www.keebtalk.com/t/how-to-best-mimic-gateron-yellow-weight-in-a-jwk-housing/17052). See the graphs in the **Other** section below.
